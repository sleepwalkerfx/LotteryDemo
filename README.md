# LotteryDemo

- Structuring the codebase with a proper dependency injection mechanism
-  Separation of concerns
- Adding localization capability
- Adopting property wrappers
- Breaking down views into more reusable components
- Enhancing testing


### Currently:
- Detail views support swipe gestures.
- The `NavigationStack` mechanism is used for navigation, but this could be improved by introducing a separate class responsible for navigation, similar to the coordinator pattern.
