# LotteryDemo


All essential requirements have been completed, and all additional requirements have been met except for two. My focus has been on improving other areas, such as:

- Structuring the codebase with a proper dependency injection mechanism
-  Separation of concerns
- Adding localization capability
- Adopting property wrappers
- Breaking down views into more reusable components
- Enhancing testing

Although some of these improvements were not explicitly required, I aimed to showcase a diverse set of skills beyond just UI enhancements.

### Currently:
- Detail views support swipe gestures.
- The `NavigationStack` mechanism is used for navigation, but this could be improved by introducing a separate class responsible for navigation, similar to the coordinator pattern.
- With more time, I would further enhance the UI, and consider modularizing the application.
